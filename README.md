# About Me
I'm Axel Anderson, a second-year Computer Science student at UNSW. My portfolio features a range of projects.

# Skills

The programming languages I am most experienced with are Python and C++. I have written a little Java through university. I am also experienced with the DBMS sqlite and mariadb. 

The areas I am most experienced in are writing REST APIs, web scraping, reverse engineering, text recognition, scripting (bash, python, powershell).

I used to daily drive linux, but now just manage personal servers running Debian and Ubuntu. I have lots of experience installing, troubleshooting and configuring software. 

I also have minimal experience with deployment and CI/CD, such as Docker and Github Actions.

I am currently working towards mastering DSA through competitive programming questions. Please see my leetcode account for statistics.
