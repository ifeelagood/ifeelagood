# Biography
My name is Axel Anderson and I am currently undertaking a computer science degree.

I have an assortment of (mostly unfinished) projects ranging from web-scraping to reverse engineering. There should be some programs written in x86 assembly thrown in for good measure.

In my spare time, I enjoy walking, cooking and playing video games such as Civilization VI and factorio. 

# Interests

My expertise and interest is significantly wide (Jack-of-all-trades, master of none). I will attempt to enumerate my interests (not skills per-se!) in no particular order:

- Web Scraping and Dataset Preprocessing
- Reverse Engineering, Malware Analysis, Binary Obsfuscation
- High Performance Computing, Parallelism and Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD), General Purpose GPU, Performance Optimisation Techniques
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Data Science, Machine Learning
- Graphics Programming/Game Engines
- Natural Language Processing, Linguistics
- Embedded Control Systems

The list could be twice as long. Unfortunately, I may not live long enough to learn everything. I will however try my best.
