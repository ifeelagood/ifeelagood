# About Me
My name is Axel Anderson and I study computer science at UNSW. I am very passionate about it.

# Skills

My most used languages are Python and C++, but i've written a bit of everything.

There are too many to list and accurately qualify, so asking me directly will be more useful than anything I put here.
